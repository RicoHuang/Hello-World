# Hello-World
hello world is hello world

        Every Day
    Every day I need you Lord
　　But this day especially，
　　I need some extra strength
　　To face what ever is to be.
　　This day more than any day
　　I need to feel you near，
　　To fortify1 my courage
　　And to overcome my fear.
　　By myself，I cannot meet
　　The challenge of the hour，
　　There are times when humans help，
　　But we need a higher power
　　To assist us bear what must be borne，
　　and so dear Lord，I pray -
　　Hold on to my trembling hand
　　And be near me today.
